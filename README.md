# Introduction

This project is a code challenge for Genial in which my challenge was to create a registration interface using React.

## Dependencies

For this project I used 3 dependencies:

- Styled Components: I used styled components for the whole page's styling.
  Styled components not only makes styling easier to do but also it makes the file a lot cleaner and with less code written in it. It is very dynamic and it allows you to interact with props.

- Typescript: I used Typescript because it's very useful and it helps keeping the code patternized and reduces human errors' probability.

- React Router Dom: I used React Router Dom because it's the best tool to work with routing in react applications.

- Material UI: I also used Material UI for some of the styling in the application.

- React Testing Library: I used React Testing Library for testing due to its practicality.

## How to run the project

To run this project, you must first install all the dependencies with:
`npm install`
Once you have all the dependencies installed, just run `npm start`

## Responsive

This project is 100% responsive and it works on every screen size from 300px wide to as much as you need.

## Observation

There are no masks nor validations for the input fields.

## File's Structure

I separated the components used in a specific page and the global components into two different folders. That way I am able to work on components that will affect the whole application but also I am able to work on components that are used only in specific pages.
